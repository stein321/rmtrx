Welcome to Rmmtrx. This app is designed to make living with multiple roommates easier. It takes care of mass txting, finances, grocery lists, and ideas that would normally be posted on a house bulletin board. The app is still in an early devleopment stage. Feel free to email stein321@gmail.com with any questions. 

After installing this on your local machine, it should be easy to install it on an android device of your choice. At this point it is designed for normal phone sizes.
